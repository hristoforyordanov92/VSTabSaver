# VSTabSaver
Visual Studio 2022 extension for saving and loading pinned/non-pinned tabs

# What does it do?
It allows you to save your currently open tabs and later load them back up.
The "pinned" state of the tabs will also be remembered and restored.

# How to use it?
Install it and at the top of Visual Studio's menu bar, inside the Tools > Tab Saver, there will be 3 commands:
- Save Pinned Tabs
- Save All Tabs
- Restore Saved Tabs

You can save the tabs whenever you want, and when you need to load them later, just press the "Restore Saved Tabs" button.
That's it!

# Why does it exist?
There's a reason why I need to delete my ".vs" folder to avoid some VS cache issues, but deleting this folder will also delete all open tabs.
This extension is helping me restore my lost tabs. That's it.
